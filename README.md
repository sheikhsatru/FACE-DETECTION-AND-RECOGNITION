# FACE-DETECTION-AND-RECOGNITION
Creating a complete face detection and recognition system involves several steps and libraries. Here, I'll outline a basic implementation using Python, OpenCV, and the face recognition library, which simplifies face detection and recognition tasks using pre-trained models
